# The Modding Bordello

**Herr Schtevie's** Discord and The Bungalo are teaming up!

For a while, we've had tons and tons of requests for NSFW modlists to be hosted in the Bungalo. However, I've always wanted to keep this community rated R and not XXX. That being said, at least one author has expressed interest in hosting a NSFW modlist. 

In comes Schtevie. We have agreed to split off hosting of modlists between the 2 Discords and make Scrolls of Schtevie (which is now renamed The Modding Bordello) to be out sister Discord. This will give us a place to redirect NSFW content and host NSFW modlists while keeping the Bungalo safe for work.

I'm super excited for this partnership. For those that don't know, Schtevie is the author of the fairly new Journals of Jyggalag modlist which aims to be one of the most next-gen experiences while offering some risque content.
