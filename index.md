The Modding Bungalo is a discord server setup by YouTuber & streamer Biggie Boss.
Originally a private discord and then a public one, **The Modding Bungalo** has evolved into a community of modders who #keepmoddingfree and now hosts several lists, content creators, mod authors and more!

## Wabbajack Lists

The Modding Bungalo is a hub for Wabbajack enthusiasts, offering a wide variety of curated modding lists that cater primarily to Skyrim but also extend to other beloved titles like Oblivion and potentially Fallout. 

Wabbajack is a powerful tool that automates the installation of large mod lists, making it easier for players to experience their favorite games in new and exciting ways.

Within this Discord community, you'll find several meticulously crafted mod lists designed by skilled modders who are dedicated to enhancing your gameplay experience. Whether you're a veteran or new to modding, our lists offer something for everyone, and our community is always ready to help you get started.

## Build your own list

The Bungalo offers support for a visual only list called NGVO which has all the essential bug fixes and modding tools combined with the visuals of a next generation game. Feel free to just take this list and play vanilla Skyrim in all its nostagic glory with the visuals of today or as a base to add to.

The Bungalo also has some modding guides like how to setup Wabbajack or LOD generation to help you build your own list. Afterall, the perfect list that has exactly what you want is the one you build yourself.
