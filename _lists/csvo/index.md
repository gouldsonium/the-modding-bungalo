## Introduction
**CSVO** is a visuals-only modlist for Skyrim SE (1.6.1170), built around [Community Shaders](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/86492). Based on [Althros Dev Tools](https://github.com/Styyx1/ADT).

This is a list made for the user to build upon and have a quick and easy full PBR Community Shaders focused setup. Things are set up to easily be pulled apart. Mesh fixes are in place to avoid the hassle of organization so you can get straight to adding your favorite overhauls and start playing.

## Post-Installation

There are a few things you can and should do. 

1. Run Bethini through the MO2 dropdown and select a preset + recommended tweaks. (Do not turn of TAA, required if you use CS' DLAA or AMDs.)
2. The CSVO separator will probably say "1.2" I made an oopsie and forgot to remove the versioning, it's wrong you are on the latest version if you updated. (I will fix this I just didn't want to push another update for that yet)
3. Read the basic instructions on modifying the list below with LOD and PGPatcher settings.

### Antivirus Exceptions
- Add exceptions in Windows Defender for the CSVO folder and `ModOrganizer.exe` to avoid crashes.
- Steps: Windows Security > Virus & Threat Protection > Manage Settings > Exclusions > Add Folder > Select CSVO folder.

### Keyboard Keybinds
- **Community Shaders**: `End` key.
- Other controls use vanilla Skyrim keybinds.

---

## Playing the Game
- Launch Skyrim SE through Mod Organizer 2 (MO2) in the CSVO folder.
- Enjoy the enhanced visuals!

---

## Updating
1. Open Wabbajack, find CSVO, and click “Download and Install.”
2. Use the same Installation and Downloads folders.
3. Backup custom mods or settings (prefix added mods with **[NoDelete]** in MO2).
4. Check [Changelog](https://github.com/InTheBottle/CSVO/blob/main/Changelog.md) for save-safe updates.

## Modifying the list
This list is meant to modded, adding and patching mods is fairly simple and I will assume you have some decent knowledge on that part already. I will provide the LOD settings used, a long with the ParallaxGen conflict load order below.
These will help you when you add new meshes or overhauls etc and have to rerun these things for yourself. The quality number I use for xLodgen aren't required and you can set those to whatever you'd like.

For LOD generation just follow this [Dragonborn's Fate LOD](https://dragonbornsfate.moddinglinked.com/lod.html)

ParallaxGen

![ParallaxGen](https://github.com/InTheBottle/CSVO/blob/main/Resources/Parallaxgen.png)


As long as you want lods and PBR, you'll generally need to rerun each of these when you add new meshes or location overhauls.
---

## Uninstalling
- Delete the CSVO folder.

---

## Troubleshooting
- **Installation Issues**:
  - Missing files? Manually download and place them in the Downloads folder.
  - Game folder not found? Ensure Skyrim SE is installed and follow [Pre-Installation](#pre-installation).
  - Antivirus flagging? Add exceptions or uninstall aggressive third-party AV (e.g., Norton).

- **Post-Installation Issues**:
  - Form 43/DLL errors? Reinstall with “Overwrite Installation” checked in Wabbajack.
  - Crashing on startup? Reinstall or seek help on [Discord](https://discord.gg/bungalo) with crash logs.

- Join [CSVO Discord](https://discord.gg/bungalo) for support.
