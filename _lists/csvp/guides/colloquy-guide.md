# Colloquy's Guide

## Levelling & Early Game
**Early game is the time to grind! Dragons wont slay themselves but you cant just rush into things...**

*The Naturalist* - Hunting/Gathering is much improved in CSVP; Purchase hunting permits to sell your goods in Hold Capitals, carry carcasses to the nearest Butcher or safe spot for processing (as it takes time now!), fish the waters of Skyrim and check in with your fellow hunters for locations of nearby dens. There are jobs posted on the Notice Board and Missives Board in almost every town & city to keep you busy!

*The Mercenary* - Maybe you're more of the nose-breaking type. Bounties now have a scaling reward system that pays more for tougher targets, but you are NOT forced into any jobs you dont want! Now when asking for work in towns you will be allowed to read the note first before accepting the job, and jobs taken from the Missives board will give you the option to abandon if your plate gets too full. Dont want to go alone? Find other Adventurers taking jobs in town and ask to join them!

*The Dragonborn* - So you're stronger now, but fauna and bandits arent the only foes in Skyrim and it will take a lot of exploring to take them all down - luckily you aren't entirely left on your own; Ask the Greybeards for guidance and they will give you the location for a Word of Power, find the journal of a long lost Scholar and use it's context clues to find the infamous Priests of the Dragon Cult, or even get the help of the Last of the Blades and use her Map to mark the Dragon Burial Mounds! Exploration is what you make of it in CSVP

## Questlines and Roleplay
**Though you are the Dragonborn of legend, in CSVP not everyone is clamoring for your attention...**

*Proven Thief* - Visiting Riften and expecting the usual harassment from Brynjolf just for him to dismiss you? For all he knows you could be a narc! Now you must have stolen 10 items for him to offer you a role in his scheme. Furthermore, once a member of the Thieves Guild you will learn of it's decrepit state and only through restoring them to glory will you unlock the Gray Cowl quest.

*What Vampire Menace?* - In the base game you're approached at Level 10 to quell the "Vampire Menace", but there is a great chance you haven't even SEEN a Vampire yet! Now you must complete 'Laid to Rest' (the Morthal side quest), uncovering a plot by the Vampires to enslave whole towns and exposing you to the menace firsthand. Durak is not your only way to start Dawnguard - notes can be found in certain Inns that will point the player to Dimhollow Crypt, allowing for a roleplay friendly start for the more vampirically inclined.

*Honor is earned* - The Companions are an order of warriors that value mettle, so there is a good chance they wont give you a second look on a new playthrough! Aela will ignore you if you don't help them at Pelagia Farm, and Vilkas will scoff at you wanting to join if you are lower than Level 10. Prove yourself and bring Honor to the Companions through their side quests for them to trust you and progress the storyline. You no longer are required to be a Werewolf but if you wish to be Harbinger you must progress a combat skill to 75 and help Kodlak with his final wish.

## Interaction and Immersion
**Interacting with the world of Skyrim is no longer black & white...**

*Can I pet that dawg?* Yes - Dynamic Activation Key adds a whole new layer to every action; Read a book in the Library without pocketing it and accruing a bounty, re-equip your sword directly from the ground after being disarmed in the heat of battle, or even skip the small talk with Merchants and immediately begin trading! The less time you spend in your menus, the more time you spend grounded in this world.

*Make use of Master Craftsmen* - Got the materials and the gold for a nice upgrade but forgot to actually level the skill? Speak with the artisans and craftsmen of the area to commission your piece, a Courier will find you in the days following when your order is complete. Smithing and Enchanting aren't the only services in Skyrim, have an Alchemist appraise an ingredient and teach you it's effects or even have stolen items laundered to sanctify them! (Guild Members only)

*This Mead empty YEET* - Even in a literal sense, interaction is improved. If you're a fan of The Last of Us, you'll love to know that you can throw things in CSVP and they will distract/entice enemies within earshot (bricks and bottles not included) adding a new way to manipulate your foes into a clever trap, or just sneak past.

*Lockpick No More!* - Lockpicking is no longer your only means of access to loot if you have a keen eye! Almost every Bandit Hideout, Cave, and Dungeon will have a hidden key that can access the Chests within. These keys can be hidden in places, in containers, on people, etc so remain perceptive!

## Combat & Enemy Interaction
**Combat has gotten a facelift in CSVP! You have a plethora of new options, but your foes have them as well...**

*Finer tuned stealth* - Enemies dont have better vision than Vanilla, but their hearing rocks! Pay attention to what you're wearing if you try to stealth around, and use the advantages at your disposal; Throw items to the other side of a room to goad enemies over there (hold and release R when grabbing an item), sneak up behind enemies and knock them out with a bash to the back of the head (doesnt work on helmeted folk), or even disguise yourself as a member of that faction and walk right through like you belong.*

*Dynamic Fights* - Animals and Humanoids alike have received all kinds of behavior improvements! A bandit will fight more recklessly than a Hold Guard, but no two bandits are alike. Dragons now vary in personality and fighting style, using Shouts and coming in half a dozen new types. Animals now adhere to their baser instincts, prioritizing self preservation when outmatched but tricky enough to lead you into situations where the tables turn.

*Power Fantasy or Power Nightmare* - Nearly 200 new spells, buffs across the board for Shouts, and an updated combat system with timed blocks means that when the gloves do come off you're ready. Your foes are ready too however and will dish back just as much as you give to them, so approach engagements in a smart way while your build takes shape!

*Disguising yourself only works within Factions that could feasibly have enough members for you to be faceless (Forsworn, Imperials/Stormcloaks, Hold Guards, etc.)*

## Fast Travel
**Survival Mode means no fast travel, but that doesnt mean you're stranded!**

**Get a carriage in every town, TO every town** - In a city that normally doesnt have a carriage? Visit the local Inn and ask the Innkeeper to request a driver! Then just sit down and wait for him to walk in. Carriage drivers now have a bunch of extra locations they can take you, you can even charter boats between port cities!

**Traversal reimagined** - With Master the Summit, Ferries of Skyrim, and Journeyman the world is more explorable than ever! Rafts, boats, and icebergs are placed all over Skyrim as seamless ways to travel over bodies of water, and new footpaths through the mountains add a revived sense of verticality. For those feeling road weary, find or purchase Travel Packs for a single use, immersive Fast Travel!

**Horses are a Nord's best friend** - With Simplest Horses, everything is handled through a single hotkey so your horse can follow you, teleport to you, and even hold things for you. Delay the next trip back into town with your faithful hooved friend!

## Inns and Taverns
**Inns and Taverns are now bustling Hubs of life & information with an immersive twist...**

*Room Renting* - Inn Rooms now have percentage chances of having No Vacancy! These odds are determined by the location, population, and importance of the city/town you're trying to rent in (Whiterun being the trading hub of Skyrim will be incredibly hard to get a room at the local inn, for example). Vacancy Percentages refresh every hour, so feel free to nap at the bar or in a chair (Hold Shift) to check in again for a warm bed!

*IT COSTS HOW MUCH?* - Just as Vacancy has been changed, so has pricing. A highly trafficked city like Solitude will always cost more to rent in than a town like Riverwood. Will you cough up the 100+ Gold to sleep in Windhelm, or travel further to rent cheaper in Kynesgrove? The choice is yours.

*One Time Thing, No More!* - Finally got that room after hours of waiting, an aching back, and a lighter coin purse? Make sure you hold on to it! Rooms can now be rented for multiple days at a time, and if you've already rented the room and need an extension just talk to the Innkeeper about staying longer.

## The Civil War
**Skyrim is in turmoil, and the fight for her freedom is more expansive than ever...**

*Troop Diversity* - Both sides in Vanilla had a knack for only recruiting Nord Males, this has been greatly improved! Armies will now feature many races and many diverse class types (Stormcloak Berserkers, Imperial Battlemages, etc) to make the battles grander. Furthermore foot patrols are now structured with backline Archers/Mages, infantry of varying ranks, and a Commander, all of whom will now have perks corresponding to their specialty and portraying them as the trained fighters they are.

*Radiant Consequences* - Linearity has been thrown out the window! Battles can be lost, resulting in your side being on the backfoot. The War is now a constant push & pull with ramifications for your failures as well as your victories. Additional choices such as convincing Balgruuf to change sides are possible, & once the War is kicked off and Holds have declared for certain sides you will be attacked on sight in an enemy hold (unless properly disguised [configurable in MCM]), making espionage a key factor in winning.

*Pick yourselves back up* - When the dust settles and the war is won or lost, reparations will begin. Workers will flock to sieged cities to attempt reconstruction, and Hold Capitals will have donation boxes that can speed this process up. Additionally, you can visit remaining enemy camps and wipe out remnants of your once indomitable foe.

## Followers
**Your followers will have your back, but in return you must have theirs too...**

*This Mortal Coil* - Followers are mortal and can die to enemies as well as yourself! They are no longer your damage sponge, and just as you would prepare yourself for a hard fight you must now also prepare them. Put potions in their inventory and they will use them when needed, and pick your fights wisely to avoid collateral damage. In the Dragonborn DLC the Black Book "Winds of Change" can give you the Companion's Insight ability, nullifying damage from attacks, shouts, and spells to your followers.

*Bonds and Benefits* - All followers now have a hidden 'Regard' system! You have a chance to gain experience by fighting alongside a teammate that is especially proficient in a skill, and as the bond between you grows they will benefit from a boost to their morale (Fear/Frenzy spells are less effective - Rank 6) AND their stats (+25 Health and Stamina - Rank 9).

*Where did they go?* - Your followers are not soulless vessels awaiting command! When you arrive to a town/city they will go off and do their own thing, meeting back up with you upon departure. If you ask a follower to wait they will only listen for 3 days max before leaving your service, as they are not fond of being forgotten. Asked a follower to wait but forgot where? Pressing G will recall all currently waiting followers to your position (will not work if they leave your service).

## Main Story
**The Main Story has seen some changes to allow more freedom...**

*Room to Breathe* - The beginning of the game is a whirlwind; Escape Helgen, run to the Jarl, run through Bleak Falls, fight your first dragon, and so on. That's exhausting! Now when you bring news of Helgen to Balgruuf you're rewarded and that's it, you're free to go do other stuff (you can progress Thaneship and even the Civil War without ever learning you're Dragonborn). When you decide you'd like to progress the Story simply speak to Balgruuf and ask if you can help with anything!

*I ain't doing allat* - Tired of Bleak Falls Barrow? Skip it! Instead of asking Balgruuf if you can help, ask him how he plans to protect Whiterun from dragons and it will immediately begin Dragon Rising. Retrieving the Dragonstone for Farengar is still required to become Thane of Whiterun so you can always do it later if you please.

*It just works* - So Delphine was unable to traverse Bleak Falls (even praising you for doing it), yet she makes it through Ustengrav? Nah. Now at the end of Ustengrav the Horn of Jurgen Windcaller will be there, allowing you to get the third word of Unrelenting Force from the Greybeards without the Delphine detour. You will still need to see Delphine eventually to progress the story but now you will speak to Farengar, request to meet his contact, and then wait a few days for a letter.
