## Installation

### Pre-Installation
1. **Install Dependencies**:
   - [Visual C++ x64](https://aka.ms/vs/17/release/vc_redist.x64.exe).
   - [.NET Runtime 8.x.x Desktop x64](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download/dotnet/thank-you/runtime-desktop-8.0.15-windows-x64-installer).
   - [.NET Runtime 6.0.0 Desktop x64](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download/dotnet/thank-you/runtime-desktop-6.0.30-windows-x64-installer).
   - If Visual C++ is installed, use the `Repair` option.

2. **Steam Setup**:
   - Disable [auto-updates for Skyrim SE](https://help.steampowered.com/en/faqs/view/71AB-698D-57EB-178C#disable).
   - Run Skyrim SE once for graphics check.
   - Run Skyrim through steam, install ALL creation club addons. Do not ALT tab during this process.
   - If you have issues with the creation club plugins missing, I highly recommend a CLEAN install of Skyrim, including completely deleting the skyrim steam folder and uninstalling.

### Wabbajack Installation
1. **Install Wabbajack**:
   - Create a folder (e.g., `C:\Wabbajack`) on your drive’s root (not in Program Files, Desktop, etc.).
   - Download [Wabbajack](https://github.com/wabbajack-tools/wabbajack/releases/latest/download/Wabbajack.exe) and place it in the folder.
   - Run `Wabbajack.exe` (requires version 4.0.0.0 or later).

2. **Install BottleRim**:
   - Open Wabbajack, select Skyrim SE, find BottleRim, and click “Download and Install.”
   - Set Installation Location (e.g., `C:\BottleRim`) and Downloads Location (avoid Program Files, Desktop, etc.).
   - Click Install.
   - Nexus Premium automates downloads; without it, manually click “Slow Download” for each mod.
   - If successful, proceed to [Post-Installation](#post-installation). If not, check [Troubleshooting](#troubleshooting).

## Post-Installation

There are a few things you can and should do. 

1. Run Bethini through the MO2 dropdown and select a preset + recommended tweaks. (Do not turn of TAA, required if you use CS' DLAA or AMDs.)

2. This list comes with a preconfigured Community Shaders setup, but feel free to press the "End" key and play around with things.

3. Check the "Optionals" separator in Mo2 to activate Framegen or camera headbob if you'd like.

4. Open the MCM, select Bathing in Skyrim and choose to either enable or leave it disabled.
   
### Antivirus Exceptions
- Add exceptions in Windows Defender for the BottleRim folder and `ModOrganizer.exe` to avoid crashes.
- Steps: Windows Security > Virus & Threat Protection > Manage Settings > Exclusions > Add Folder > Select BottleRim folder.

### Keyboard Keybinds
- **Community Shaders**: `End` key.
- Other controls use vanilla Skyrim keybinds.

---

## Playing the Game
- Launch Skyrim SE through Mod Organizer 2 (MO2) in the BottleRim folder.
- Enjoy the enhanced visuals!
- If you use a controller/gamepad, Left Trigger is now used for Dynamic activation key. It works when you have your weapon sheathed and you use it by holding the trigger and pressing the activate button. This works for a lot of things try it out!
- Add Crusader, an uncapper preset made by Simon Magus. Players will now be locked to 62 perk points, so choose wisely!

---

## Updating
1. Open Wabbajack, find BottleRim, and click “Download and Install.”
2. Use the same Installation and Downloads folders.
3. Backup custom mods or settings (prefix added mods with **[NoDelete]** in MO2).
4. Check [Changelog](https://github.com/InTheBottle/BottleRim/blob/main/Changelog.md) for save-safe updates.

---

## Modifying the list
There are a couple mods you should check out in the MCM to customize how you would like to play.

- Helmet Toggle 2
- Bathing in Skyrim

  Helmet Toggle 2 is awesome and you can set the hotkey and conditions in the MCM to whatever you'd like.

  Bathing in Skyrim comes disabled by default, some people may not want this so if you do be sure to enable it before leaving the starting cell.
---

## Uninstalling
- Delete the BottleRim folder.

---

## Troubleshooting
- **Installation Issues**:
  - Missing files? Manually download and place them in the Downloads folder.
  - Game folder not found? Ensure Skyrim SE is installed and follow [Pre-Installation](#pre-installation).
  - Antivirus flagging? Add exceptions or uninstall aggressive third-party AV (e.g., Norton).

- **Post-Installation Issues**:
  - Form 43/DLL errors? Reinstall with “Overwrite Installation” checked in Wabbajack.
  - Crashing on startup? Reinstall or seek help on [Discord](https://discord.gg/bungalo) with crash logs.
