# Safe to Modify
**Rule 11:** "If you make any changes to the mod lists, note that we cannot offer you help for issues that arise from those changes." However, there are some features that are safe to modify through the MCM (Mod Configuration Menu).

## Safe MCM Modifications

### SkyUI
- **Allowed Modifications:** Size options, hotkeys.
- **Warning:** **DO NOT** touch anything else.

### Better Third Person Selector
- **Allowed Modifications:** Enabling/disabling features should be fine.

### Leveling Freedom, Experience, Static Skill Leveling
- **Allowed Modifications:** You can use these to tweak your XP/skill gain if you don't like my settings.

### Smoothcam
- **Allowed Modifications:** Selecting a preset, modifying the shoulder swap key, etc.

### True Directional Movement
- **Allowed Modifications:** Setting your target lock key.

### One Click Power Attack
- **Allowed Modifications:** Changing the power attack button.

### Immersive Spell Learning
- **Allowed Modifications:** Reduce the spell learning modifier down to 1 hour if you don't like the system.

### Wintersun Faiths
- **Allowed Modifications:** Changing devotion gain/loss rates, disabling apostasy.

### Requiem
- **Allowed Modifications:** Turning off smithing skill book requirements.

## Important Notes

Turning on/off certain MCM features can break things. Outside of this list, the MCM is set up in the intended manner, and touching anything else breaks **Rule 11**. If you think an MCM option you want to change isn't on this list, please let me know on Discord, and I will review it.
